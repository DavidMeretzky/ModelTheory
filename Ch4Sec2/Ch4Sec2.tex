\maketitle

Let $P(V,\mathscr{R})$ be the reduced first order algebra on $(V,\mathscr{R})$. We would like to create semantics for $P(V,\mathscr{R})$ in such a way that the statement that a certain collection of variables in $V$ which we interpret in the context of some set $U$, satisfy some relation in $\mathscr{R}$ is true if and only if the relation is satisfied in that context.\\

In particular, if we are interested in some collection of mathematical objects $U$ we can think of an element $x \in V$ as being the name of the object $u \in U$ by defining a function $\varphi:V \rightarrow U$ such that $\varphi(x) = u$. Similarly, if there exists a relation on the set $U$ and we want to disucss whether or not variables like $x$ satisfy the relation in $\mathscr{R}_U$, we define a function $\psi:\mathscr{R} \rightarrow \mathscr{R}_U$. By letting $\psi(r) = r_U$ we represent a relation $r_U$ on $U$ by a relation $r$ on $V$.\\

Let $P_k(V,\mathscr{R})$ be the set of all elements $p$ of $P(V,\mathscr{R})$ with $d(p) \leq k$. \\

Define the valuation $v:P \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2$ by the following properties:\\

$(\text{a})$ $v(r(x_1,..,x_n)) = 1$ if $\varphi(x_1),..,\varphi(x_n) \in \psi(r)$ and $0$ otherwise.\\
$(\text{b})$ $v$ is still a $\{\Rightarrow, \textbf{F}\}$-algebra homomorphism.\\
$(\text{c}_\text{k})$ Suppose $p = (\forall x)q(x)$ has depth $k$. Put $V' = V \cup \{t\}$ where $t \notin V$. If for every extension $\varphi':V' \rightarrow U$ of $\varphi$ and for every $v_{k-1}:P_{k-1}(V, \mathscr{R})\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2$, such that $(\varphi',\psi,v_{k-1}')$ satisfy (a), (b) and $(\text{c}_\text{i})$, for all $i < k$, we have $v_{k-1}'(q(t))=1$, then $v(p) = 1$, otherwise $v(p) = 0$.\\  

The idea is that $\forall x q(x)$ should be true if and only if for every possible interpretation $t$ $q(t)$ is still true at depth $k-1$, where $t$ is a new variable and thus interpreting $t$ differently in $U$ changes only $t$. 

\begin{problem}
Given $(U, \varphi, \psi)$ there is exactly one function $v:P \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_2$ satisfying (a), (b) and $(\text{c}_\text{k})$ for all $k$. 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Let $w$ and $v$ both be functions which satistfy (a), (b) and $(\text{c}_\text{k})$ for all $k$. Let $p \in P$ at depth $0$. By (a), $w(p) = v(p)$. Suppose $v = w$ up to depth $k-1$. Let $p = (\forall x) q(x) \in P$ at depth $k$.\\ 

We have that $v(p) = 1$ only if for all possible interpretations of a new variable $t$, $v_{k-1}'(q(t))=1$ suppose there is an interpretation of $t$, $\varphi'(t)$ such that $v_{k-1}'(q(t))=0$, then $w_{k-1}'(q(t))=0$ by the induction hypothesis $v_{k-1}' = w_{k-1}'$ since they have the same triple $(U, \varphi', \psi)$, therefore, $v = w$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
An $interpretation$ of $P = P(V,\mathscr{R})$ in the domain $U$ is a quadruple $(U,\varphi,\psi,v)$ satisfy the conditions (a), (b) and $(\text{c}_\text{k})$ for all $k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Let $w(u_1,..,u_n)$ be any tautology of $Prop(\{u_1,...,u_n\})$. Let $p_1,...,p_n \in P(V,\mathscr{R})$. Prove that $\vDash w(p_1,...,p_n)$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Note that $v$ is required to be a $\{\Rightarrow, \textbf{F}\}$-algebra homomorphism. Thus $v(w(p_1,...,p_n)) = w(v(p_1),...,v(p_n))$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2$. However, regardless of the truth value of $v(p_1),...,v(p_n)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $w(v(p_1),...,v(p_n)) = 1$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
Let $A \subseteq P(V,\mathscr{R})$ and $p(x) \in A$ for all $x \in V$. Does it follow that $A \vDash (\forall x)p(x)$? No, it does not follow.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Let $u \in U$ such that $u \notin range(\varphi) \subseteq U$.\footnote{The text explicitly states ``Of course, not every element $u \in U$ need have a name, while some elements $u$ may well have more than one name."} Let $(U,\varphi,\psi,v)$ be an interpretation such that $v(q) = 1$ for all $q \in A$. Let $\varphi'$ be the extension of $\varphi$ such that $\varphi'(t) = u$. Then we have no knowledge about the value of $v(p(t))$. For contrast, if we take $v(p(x))$, we know that $p(x) \in A$ thus $v(p(x)) = 1$.  
\end{proof}

In particular, the statement ``For any $x$ in $A$, $v(p(x)) = 1$" describes quantification over the range of $\phi$, a subset of $U$, while the expression  ``$v((\forall x)p(x)) = 1$" describes quantification over the entirety of $U$. The trick of requiring $t \notin V$ is exactly adding a basepoint of $V$ to encode that $\phi$ is potentially a partial function. \footnote{The category of sets and partial functions is equivalent to the category of sets with specified base point and total functions.}
